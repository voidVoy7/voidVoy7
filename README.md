## ğŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm void  

I'm a developer from **Poland ğŸ‡µğŸ‡±** who loves giving myself *unnecessarily difficult* programming challenges â€” and then slowly losing my mind trying to finish them ğŸ˜….  

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub, where I share my coding adventures and experiments.

### ğŸ§  About Me
- ğŸ’» Currently exploring **too many things to list ;/**
- ğŸ§© I like experimenting, breaking things, and (eventually) fixing them  
- ğŸ”­ Not focused on any particular project right now â€” just following curiosity  
- â˜• Fueled by coffee and questionable ideas that somehow turn into code
