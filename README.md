## About Me
I'm a developer from **Poland**, using **Linux** as my daily operating system.  
I enjoy working on projects that capture my interest â€” regardless of their scope, technology, or field.

## Approach
I focus on ideas that spark my curiosity and use the languages and tools I feel most comfortable with to bring them to life.  
This profile is a collection of **experiments**, **utilities**, and **learning projects** that reflect that mindset.
